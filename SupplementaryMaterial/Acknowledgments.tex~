\noindent\textbf{\huge\textsf{Acknowledgements}}\\\\

\noindent The work presented in this thesis represents the culmination
of over 6 years of research.  I did not embark upon this endeavor
alone, and here I wish to thank the people who supported me the most
along the way.

First and foremost, I owe a profound thank you to my thesis
supervisor Dr. Alison Sills.  Her patient guidance, support, and
friendship made my journey through graduate school not only
successful, but enjoyeable.  
I am grateful for all of her creative input and meticulous advice, and
this thesis has been made immeasurably stronger because of it.  Her
dedicated support of my education and her relentless encouragement of
my pursuits were unwavering.  The woman is a hero.  A heart-felt thank
you must also be extended to Dr. Christian Knigge and Dr. Robert
Mathieu whose guidance, advice and tutelage have played a significant
role in shaping my abilities and identity as a researcher and scientist.

I also wish to thank my parents.  I am incredibly fortunate to be able
to look upon my parents as friends.  There is nobody in this world who
knows me better, and your acceptance and support have meant everything
to me.  This thesis is for you.  A sincere thank you to my brother
Peter as well, for setting 
the bar high when it came to a great many things.  Despite being the
big brother, I have looked up to you often.

I also wish to thank my thesis advisors and committtee members
Dr. Bill Harris and Dr. Alan Chen.  Your insight and guidance
have helped me greatly, and this thesis would not be what it is 
without you.

Finally, I wish to thank my friends and collaborators.  You have
influenced me in countless ways, and have helped shape my perception
of the world.  Not only have your words given me inspiration, they
have made me laugh, smile and cry time and time again.  For this
I will always be grateful.  There are too many of you to list here by
name, however Dr. Aaron Geller, 
Dr. Evert Glebbeek, and Dr. Charles-Philippe Lajoie must be mentioned
explicitly for their contributions to the work presented in this
thesis.
